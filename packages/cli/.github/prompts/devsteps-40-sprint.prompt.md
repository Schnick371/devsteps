# 🏃 Sprint Execution

> **Reasoning:** Think through scope, risks, and approach before any action. For large or cross-cutting tasks, use extended reasoning — analyze alternatives and consequences before executing.


The **sprint-executor autonomously classifies the incoming task, selects agent combinations, and manages multi-hour execution.** No additional user direction is needed for agent selection or mode choice — the agent determines this from context.

Depending on what is detected (single item, multi-item backlog, spike, review), the sprint-executor selects the right subset of its 13 registered agents automatically. For a true multi-item sprint it runs: backlog pre-flight → per-item MPD loop with risk-tiered agent dispatch → adaptive replanning. Reviewer blocks every item.

---

## Phase 0 — Pre-Sprint (run once before the loop)

1. **`devsteps-analyst-context-subagent`** → global archaeology → write `.devsteps/analysis/sprint-[DATE]/global-context.md`
2. **`devsteps-aspect-staleness-subagent`** (batch prompt, all `planned` items) → mark `obsolete`/`blocked` before execution
3. **`devsteps-planner`** → receives: backlog list + global-context → produces **Enriched Sprint Brief**:
   - Ordered execution sequence (Q1 → Q2 → Q3), per-item risk score (QUICK/STANDARD/FULL)
   - Shared-file conflict map, cross-package build order, `depends-on` chain resolution
   - Write to `.devsteps/analysis/sprint-[DATE]/enriched-sprint-brief.md`

---

## Phase 1 — Per-Item Loop

For each item in the Enriched Sprint Brief IN ORDER:

### Triage Gate — deterministic, no LLM call

| Tier | Triggers | Agents dispatched (parallel where marked) |
|---|---|---|
| **QUICK** | Single-file, docs-only, isolated config, full test coverage | `impl-subagent` only |
| **STANDARD** | Cross-file, shared module, API surface, partial test coverage | `aspect-staleness` + `aspect-impact` (parallel) → `impl + test` (parallel) |
| **FULL** | Schema change, cross-package, CRITICAL risk, STALE-CONFLICT | All 5 aspects (parallel) → synthesis → `impl + test + doc` (parallel, file paths only) |
| **COMPETITIVE** | "Which pattern/library/approach?" detected in item description | `analyst-internal` + `analyst-web` (parallel) → Judge → `impl` + optionally `planner` |

### Item Execution Steps

1. Create feature branch **now** (not at sprint start): `story/<ID>`, `task/<ID>`, `bug/<ID>`
2. Set status `→ in-progress`
3. Dispatch analysts per triage tier — max 5 parallel calls per turn
4. Synthesize envelopes → Enriched Task Brief; pass **file paths only** to specialists (never paste report content)
5. **`devsteps-reviewer`** — **BLOCKING**: await PASS before advancing to next item
   - FAIL → pause sprint, surface conflict to user, do NOT proceed
6. Merge to main (`--no-ff`), retain branch ≥ 8 weeks
7. Set status `→ done`
8. Checkpoint: write `.devsteps/analysis/sprint-[DATE]/item-[ID]-summary.md` (3-line summary + verdict)

### Cross-Package Rules

- After any `packages/shared` item lands → run `npm run build --workspace=packages/shared` before next `impl-subagent` dispatch
- Track modified files in `.devsteps/analysis/sprint-[DATE]/invalidation-cache.md`; if next item's `affected_paths` overlaps → re-invoke `analyst-context` scoped to those files only
- **Changelog entries**: collect all, consolidate into CHANGELOG at **end of sprint** (not per item — causes merge conflicts)

---

## Phase 2 — Adaptive Replanning (every 5 items OR every 2 hours)

1. **`devsteps-analyst-context-subagent`** (delta: `git diff HEAD~5..HEAD`) → update global context
2. **`devsteps-planner`** (remaining items + delta) → rerank, detect newly invalid items
3. If any `packages/shared` item completed in prior batch → force staleness re-evaluation on all remaining items touching `packages/cli/` or `packages/mcp-server/`

---

## Operational Constraints

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Time-box: QUICK | ≤ 20 min — exceeded → downscope or pause |
| Time-box: STANDARD | ≤ 45 min — exceeded → downscope or pause |
| Time-box: FULL | ≤ 90 min — exceeded → split item or pause |
| Context saturation | > 70% session window → force checkpoint + summary before next item |
| Parallel subagent cap | Max 5 per turn |
| Competitive mode | Only if FULL-tier item has explicit strategy question — doubles cost |

---

## Pause Triggers → Stop Sprint, Surface to User

- Reviewer FAIL that would invalidate subsequent items
- Architecture decision required (not in Enriched Sprint Brief)
- Item exceeds tier time-box with no clear downscope path
- Context saturation threshold crossed
- Acceptance criteria genuinely ambiguous

**On pause:** set item `→ in-progress`, write blockers to `.devsteps/analysis/[ID]/sprint-pause.md`, generate session summary with remaining item list.

## Prompt Ecosystem

| Situation | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Need deep planning before sprint | `devsteps-10-plan-work` → then return here |
| Single item only | `devsteps-20-start-work` (Standard MPD) |
| Kanban pull, no ceremony | `devsteps-30-rapid-cycle` |
| Review only | `devsteps-25-review` |
| Investigation / archaeology | `devsteps-05-investigate` |
