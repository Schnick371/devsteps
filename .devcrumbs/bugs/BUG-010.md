This is a test bug to verify that the TreeView automatically refreshes when new items are created via CLI or MCP tools.

**Expected behavior:**
TreeView should update immediately without manual reload.

**Test scenario:**
1. Create this bug via MCP tool
2. Check TreeView - should show BUG-010 immediately
3. If visible without reload → FileSystemWatcher works! ✅
