# DevCrumbs Platform - AI-First Development Workflow System

## Vision
Create a comprehensive development workflow system that enables AI assistants to participate effectively in software development through structured work item tracking, traceability, and context management.

## Core Philosophy
- **AI-Native Design**: Built from the ground up for AI assistant collaboration
- **Traceability First**: Every change tracked, linked, and documented
- **Methodology Agnostic**: Supports Scrum, Waterfall, and Hybrid approaches
- **Developer Experience**: Seamless integration with modern development tools

## Key Components
1. **MCP Server**: Protocol-based AI integration
2. **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for developers
3. **VS Code Extension**: IDE integration with TreeView and WebView
4. **Shared Core**: Type-safe, reusable business logic

## Success Criteria
- ✅ AI assistants can autonomously manage work items
- ✅ Full traceability from requirement to implementation
- ✅ Zero-friction adoption for development teams
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing workflows

## Technical Stack
- TypeScript + Node.js
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- VS Code Extension API
- Monorepo (npm workspaces)

## Target Audience
- Development teams using AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor)
- Projects requiring strict traceability and documentation
- Agile and traditional software development methodologies
