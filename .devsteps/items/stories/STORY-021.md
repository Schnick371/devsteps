## User Stories
- As designer, I want multiple logo concepts to compare visual approaches
- As team, I want user testing to select winning design objectively
- As developer, I want final logo ready for Activity Bar and Marketplace

## Scope
Create and compare 3 distinct DevSteps logo concepts, each with 3-4 variations:
1. **Concept 1**: Copilot's View of Sprint (Scrum board through glasses)
2. **Concept 2**: Footsteps + Glasses Hybrid (human & AI walking together)
3. **Concept 3**: Step Dots Through Lens (progress path with AI focus)

## Design Requirements (All Concepts)
- **Circular visible area** (square canvas, round focus)
- **Human-AI partnership** visual metaphor
- **Copilot reference** (glasses icon integration)
- **Elements can extend** beyond circle if needed
- **28×28 SVG** (Activity Bar) + **128×128 PNG** (Marketplace)
- **Monochrome-first** (currentColor theme compatibility)
- **2px stroke weight**, round linecap/linejoin

## Process
1. Design each concept with 3-4 variations (TASK-072, TASK-073, TASK-074)
2. Mockup in VS Code Activity Bar context (light + dark themes)
3. User testing workshop - compare all variations side-by-side
4. Select winning design based on: recognizability, uniqueness, theme compatibility
5. Produce final assets (SVG + PNG exports)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ 9-12 total icon variations created (3-4 per concept)
- ✅ All mockups in realistic VS Code context
- ✅ Clear winner selected through structured evaluation
- ✅ Final logo passes VS Code marketplace guidelines
- ✅ DevSteps brand identity established

## Deliverables
- Concept sketches documentation
- Variation comparison matrix
- User testing results
- Selected design rationale
- Production-ready icon files
