Implement export capabilities + flexible relationship visualization in dashboard. **Dashboard displays:** depends-on, tests, supersedes (non-critical relations). **TreeView displays:** tested-by, required-by (critical relations). Support PDF/HTML/CSV export. User Stories: Team lead exports dashboard as PDF. Developer analyzes relationships via dashboard. Manager shares HTML report. Acceptance Criteria: Dashboard shows all flexible relations (depends-on, tests, supersedes). Export preserves relationship visualizations. File size: PDF <2MB, HTML <500KB. Error handling for large datasets.
