# User Story (CANCELLED)

**Cancelled reason:** AITK tools (`aitk-*`) are scoped to **Python/C# code generation** with Microsoft Agent Framework. Our `.github/agents/*.agent.md` files are Copilot Chat instruction Markdown files — not Python code. An AITK instructions file applied to `**/*.agent.md` would provide irrelevant Python guidance.

**If still wanted:** A useful variant would be an instructions file for MCP server TypeScript development (structured logging, OpenTelemetry tracing) — this is covered better by STORY-087.
