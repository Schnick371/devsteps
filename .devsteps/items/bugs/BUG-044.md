## Problem
Test #5 fails: In complex relationship chains (multiple implements + depends-on), not all links visible in get output.

## Reproduction
1. Create Epic, 2 Stories, 2 Tasks
2. Create complex links: TASK→STORY, STORY→EPIC, STORY2 depends-on STORY1
3. `devsteps get STORY-001`
4. Expected: Should show all relationships
5. Actual: Some links missing (STORY-002 not visible)

## Impact
- MEDIUM: Complex workflows hard to navigate
- Missing context in multi-level hierarchies
- Test fails: scrum-hierarchy.bats Line 283

## Expected Behavior
All direct relationships should be visible regardless of chain complexity

## Test Evidence
`tests/integration/cli/scrum-hierarchy.bats` Line 283
