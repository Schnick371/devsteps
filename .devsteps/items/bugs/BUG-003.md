Menu checkmarks implemented using duplicate command approach from LessonsLearned project.

## Solution
Implemented working menu checkmarks by:
- Added duplicate commands for each toggle option (active/inactive variants)
- Active commands have checkmark prefix `$(check)` and `enablement: false`
- Inactive commands perform the actual action
- Proper when clauses control which command variant shows
- Hidden all duplicate commands from Command Palette

## Implementation Details
- View Mode: `.flat.active/.inactive` and `.hierarchical.active/.inactive`
- Hierarchy: `.scrum.active/.inactive`, `.waterfall.active/.inactive`, `.both.active/.inactive` 
- Hide Done: `.hideDone.active/.inactive`
- Updated submenu with proper when clauses
- Commands registered in TypeScript with no-op for active, action for inactive

## Verification
Extension rebuilt, repackaged and reinstalled - checkmarks now work correctly in view/title menus.
