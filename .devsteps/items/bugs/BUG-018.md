# Verify All Status Badges Implementation

## Task
Check that all 8 status values from TASK-009 spec are correctly implemented in `decorationProvider.ts` with correct badge characters.

## Expected Status Mapping (TASK-009)
1. ✅ draft → ○
2. ✅ planned → ◷  
3. ✅ in-progress → ●
4. ✅ review → ◎
5. ✅ done → ✓
6. ✅ blocked → ✖
7. ✅ cancelled → −
8. ✅ obsolete → ⊗

## Already Verified
All 8 status values are correctly implemented in lines 74-105 of `decorationProvider.ts`.

## Current Implementation Status
✅ **ALL CORRECT** - No changes needed!

Each status has:
- Correct Unicode badge character
- Appropriate tooltip text
- Proper fallback for unknown status (`?`)

## Colors Status
**DO NOT CHANGE COLORS** - They are already perfect with ThemeColor implementation!

## Conclusion
This bug can be marked as **invalid** - all status badges are already correctly implemented according to TASK-009 specification.

## Files Checked
- `packages/extension/src/decorationProvider.ts` (lines 74-105)
