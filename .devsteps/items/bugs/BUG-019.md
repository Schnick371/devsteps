# TreeView Provider Registration Failure in VSIX

## Problem
- **Debug Mode**: TreeView works perfectly ✅
- **Installed VSIX**: "There is no data provider registered" ❌

## Root Cause Analysis
Extension activation differs between development and production builds:
1. **Development**: Extension Host loads source directly
2. **Production**: VSIX uses bundled/minified code with esbuild

## Likely Causes
1. **Build externalization**: `external: ['vscode', 'zod']` might exclude required dependencies
2. **Import resolution**: ES modules vs CommonJS mismatch in bundled code
3. **Activation timing**: Race condition in TreeView registration
4. **Module loading**: Dynamic imports not resolved in bundle

## Debugging Steps
1. Check VS Code Developer Console for errors
2. Verify extension.js bundle contains TreeDataProvider
3. Test activation events and timing
4. Compare debug vs production build outputs

## Solution Approaches
1. Fix esbuild configuration (add missing dependencies)
2. Ensure proper activation sequence
3. Add error handling in TreeView registration
4. Test with minimal build externals
