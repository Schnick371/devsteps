## Problem

`isPreRelease()` in `mcpServerManager.ts` only checked if the minor version was odd:

```typescript
const minor = parseInt(version.split('.')[1] ?? '0', 10);
return minor % 2 !== 0;
```

With extension version `1.0.1` (odd patch, even minor), this returned `false`, so the extension used the `@latest` MCP server instead of `@next`. This broke the requirement that pre-release extension must connect to `@next` MCP server.

## Root Cause

VS Code Marketplace recommends odd *minor* for pre-releases (1.1.x) but does not mandate it. The extension was at version `1.0.1` (stable minor, odd patch), which is a valid pre-release version format when published via `vsce publish --pre-release`.

## Fix

Extended detection to cover both conventions:

```typescript
const parts = version.split('.');
const minor = parseInt(parts[1] ?? '0', 10);
const patch = parseInt(parts[2] ?? '0', 10);
// Odd minor (1.1.x) OR odd patch with even minor (1.0.1)
return minor % 2 !== 0 || patch % 2 !== 0;
```

## Key Learning

**There is NO `"preRelease": true` field in `package.json`** for marking extensions as pre-release. The only mechanism is:
- CLI: `vsce publish --pre-release`
- Manual upload via Marketplace UI only has a checkbox at first upload; subsequent uploads cannot re-select it via UI → **must use `vsce publish --pre-release`**
