## Problem
Test #20 fails: Feature with `tested-by` relationship doesn't show test links in get output.

## Reproduction
1. Create Feature
2. Create Test item
3. Link with `devsteps link FEAT-001 tested-by TEST-001`
4. `devsteps get FEAT-001`
5. Expected: Should show `tested-by: TEST-001`
6. Actual: Test link not visible

## Impact
- HIGH: Test coverage invisible
- Can't verify testing completeness
- Test fails: waterfall-hierarchy.bats Line 315

## Expected Behavior
Item should display tested-by relationships in get output

## Test Evidence
`tests/integration/cli/waterfall-hierarchy.bats` Line 315
