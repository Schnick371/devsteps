## Problem
Test #17 fails with ENOENT when creating Spike in Waterfall methodology:
`ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.devsteps/items/spikes/SPIKE-001.json'`

## Reproduction
1. `devsteps init test-waterfall --methodology waterfall`
2. `devsteps add spike "Technical Investigation"`
3. Error: Directory .devsteps/items/spikes/ doesn't exist

## Impact
- CRITICAL: Blocks Spike creation in Waterfall
- Spikes are essential for research tasks
- Test suite cannot validate Spike workflows

## Expected Behavior
Init should create spikes/ directory for Waterfall methodology

## Test Evidence
`tests/integration/cli/waterfall-hierarchy.bats` Line 139
