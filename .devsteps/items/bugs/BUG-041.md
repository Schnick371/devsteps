## Problem
Test #19 fails: Feature with `depends-on` relationship doesn't show dependency in get output.

## Reproduction
1. Create two Features
2. Link with `devsteps link FEAT-002 depends-on FEAT-001`
3. `devsteps get FEAT-002`
4. Expected: Should show `depends-on: FEAT-001`
5. Actual: Dependency not visible

## Impact
- HIGH: Dependencies invisible
- Can't track what must be done first
- Test fails: waterfall-hierarchy.bats Line 274

## Expected Behavior
Item should display depends-on relationships in get output

## Test Evidence
`tests/integration/cli/waterfall-hierarchy.bats` Line 274
