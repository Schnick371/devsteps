## Problem
Test #4 and #8 fail: Bug created with `blocks` relationship not shown in Story's get output.

## Reproduction
1. Create Story
2. Create Bug with `devsteps link BUG-XXX blocks STORY-XXX`
3. `devsteps get STORY-XXX`
4. Expected: Should show blocked-by relationship
5. Actual: Bug not visible in Story output

## Impact

- Blocks transparency of workflow blockers
- Tests fail: scrum-hierarchy.bats Line 223, 440

## Expected Behavior
Story should show `blocked-by: BUG-XXX` in relationships section

## Test Evidence
- Test #4: `scrum-hierarchy.bats` Line 223
- Test #8: `scrum-hierarchy.bats` Line 440
