## Problem
Test #10 fails: When linking Story → Epic with `implements`, Epic doesn't show `implemented-by` in get output.

## Reproduction
1. Create Epic
2. Create Story
3. Link with `devsteps link STORY-001 implements EPIC-001`
4. `devsteps get EPIC-001`
5. Expected: Should show `implemented-by: STORY-001`
6. Actual: Bidirectional link not visible

## Impact
- HIGH: Reverse relationships invisible
- Can't see what implements an Epic/Requirement
- Test fails: scrum-hierarchy.bats Line 524

## Expected Behavior
Both sides of bidirectional relationships should be visible:
- STORY shows `implements: EPIC-001`
- EPIC shows `implemented-by: STORY-001`

## Test Evidence
`tests/integration/cli/scrum-hierarchy.bats` Line 524
