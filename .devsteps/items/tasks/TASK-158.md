# Update devsteps-start-work.prompt.md

## Completed Implementation

Updated prompt with concise branch strategy workflow:

### Changes Made:
1. **Mission Section:** Added "Branch Strategy" and "Critical Rule" notes
2. **Step 0: Branch Strategy (MANDATORY):** 
   - Phase 1: Verify work items in main
   - Phase 2: Create/checkout feature branch
   - Phase 3: Verify clean state
3. **Step 6: Complete:** Updated commit workflow - feature branch only, no merge yet
4. **Status Sync:** Explained temporary divergence between branches

### Result:
- Clear 3-phase branch setup (concise)
- Feature branch discipline enforced
- Status sync expectations set
- Production-ready implementation

## Success Criteria Met:
- ✅ Step 0 verifies items in main (Phase 1)
- ✅ Step 0 creates/checks out feature branch (Phase 2)
- ✅ Step 6 commits to feature branch only
- ✅ Clear separation: items (main) vs code (feature)
- ✅ Mission statement updated
- ✅ Kept concise for Copilot consumption

**Note:** Implementation is more concise than original task spec - this is intentional and better for usability.
