# TASK-085: Create GitHub Repository for Open Source Publication

## Updated Goal
User wants to share FULL SOURCE CODE on GitHub so others can help improve DevSteps!

**Original Plan:** Docs-only repository
**New Plan:** Full source code repository

## Status: OBSOLETE
Since the user wants to upload the full source code, this task (creating a docs-only repo) is no longer needed. The main repository will contain everything.

## What Gets Published Instead
The main devsteps repository will contain:
- Full source code (all packages)
- Documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- DevSteps workflow system (.devsteps/)
- Build configuration
- GitHub workflows

## Acceptance Criteria (for main repo)
- ✅ GitHub repo public with full source
- ✅ All legal/community files present (LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING)
- ✅ Build and test instructions in README
- ✅ Others can clone, build, and contribute
