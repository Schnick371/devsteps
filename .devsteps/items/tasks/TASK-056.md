Create velocity chart showing completed story points per sprint (configurable duration: 1-4 weeks). Chart displays: ideal velocity (average), actual velocity (bars), trend line. Data source: tasks with story_points field + completed_date. Chart type: Bar chart with overlay line (Chart.js or custom Canvas). Filters: date range, item types (story/task). Configuration: sprint duration setting in VS Code preferences. Performance: Aggregate data server-side, render client-side with <100ms. Accessibility: Data table alternative view, keyboard navigation.
