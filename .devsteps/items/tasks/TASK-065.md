Create initial logo concepts exploring DevSteps brand metaphor. Metaphor: Footsteps (developer journey), stepping stones (incremental progress), path forward (workflow clarity). Design exploration: Sketch 3-5 concepts: footprint icon, connected steps/dots, forward arrow with steps, staircase/ladder metaphor, developer + AI partnership visual. Requirements: Simple geometry (recognizable at small size), works in monochrome, scalable vector, no gradients/shadows. Process: Digital sketches in SVG, mockups in VS Code Activity Bar context, team review and selection. Deliverables: Concept sketches document, selected design rationale, icon-only version (square) and full logo version (with text). Tool suggestions: Figma, Inkscape, or Illustrator for vector work.
