Implement export capabilities for dashboard data and visualizations. Support PDF (printable reports), HTML (shareable standalone), and CSV (data analysis). User Stories: As team lead, export dashboard as PDF for stakeholder meetings. As developer, export CSV for custom analysis. As manager, share HTML report via email. Acceptance Criteria: Export command in dashboard (button or context menu). PDF export preserves visual styling and charts. HTML export is self-contained (inline CSS/JS). CSV export includes all metrics with headers. File size optimization: PDF <2MB, HTML <500KB. Error handling for large datasets.
