Enhance activity timeline with interactive filters, velocity charts (story points per sprint), Gantt-style project overview (epics/stories with start/end dates), and item lifecycle tracking (status transitions over time). User Stories: As developer, see sprint velocity trends. As team lead, view Gantt-style project timeline. As stakeholder, understand item lifecycle durations. Acceptance Criteria: Velocity chart with configurable sprint duration. Gantt view shows epics/stories with date ranges. Lifecycle view tracks status transition timestamps. Performance: Sub-1-second render for 500+ items. Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels.
