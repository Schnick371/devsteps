Export dashboard metrics as CSV for custom analysis in Excel/Google Sheets. Export types: Work items (all fields: id, type, title, status, priority, dates, links), statistics (aggregated counts by type/status/priority), velocity data (sprint metrics), cycle time data (status durations). CSV format: UTF-8 with BOM (Excel compatibility), headers in first row, quoted fields (commas in text), ISO 8601 dates. Multiple files: items.csv, stats.csv, velocity.csv OR single file with sheets (Excel format). UX: Export all or filtered data, column selection dialog (optional), progress for large exports.
