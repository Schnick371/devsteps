Track and visualize item status transitions over time (draft → planned → in-progress → review → done). Data model: Add status_history array to work items with {status, timestamp, user} entries. Visualization: Swimlane timeline showing status changes, cycle time metrics (time in each status), bottleneck detection (items stuck in status). Implementation: Extend update operations to record status_history. UI: Timeline view per item OR aggregate view for all items. Metrics: Average cycle time per status, WIP limits visualization. Migration: Backfill existing items with created/updated as initial transitions.
