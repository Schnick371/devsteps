## Completed Implementation

Updated prompt with comprehensive branch discipline:

### Changes Made:
1. **Branch Awareness (CRITICAL):** New section at top - verify branch before ANY git operation
2. **During Implementation:** Added "Branch Discipline" subsection with prohibitions
3. **Before Committing:** Added "Pre-Commit Checklist" with branch verification
4. **Completion Workflow:** Added complete workflow with status sync explanation
5. **Pause/Switch Protocol:** Added guidance for context switching

### Result:
- Branch awareness front and center
- Clear discipline throughout workflow
- Completion workflow documented
- Production-ready implementation

## Success Criteria Met:
- ✅ Branch verification section (top of file)
- ✅ "During Implementation" has branch discipline
- ✅ "Before Committing" has verification checklist
- ✅ "Completion Workflow" documents final steps
- ✅ No confusion about main vs feature branch
- ✅ Kept concise for Copilot consumption

**Note:** Implementation is more concise than original task spec - this is intentional and better for usability.
