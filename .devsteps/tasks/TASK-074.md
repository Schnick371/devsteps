## Concept Overview
**Visual**: Connected stepping stones (dots) forming path, viewed through AI magnifying/analysis lens - cleanest geometry.

## Design Elements
- **Circle = Lens/Viewport**: Large circle represents AI's analytical view
- **5-6 connected dots**: Stepping stones path (DevSteps = incremental progress)
- **Current step highlighted**: One dot larger/filled (focus point)
- **Subtle glasses reflection**: Lens edge shows Copilot glasses reflection
- **All within circle**: Perfect containment for clean 28×28 rendering

## Symbolism
- DevSteps literal: Steps as connected dots showing progress
- AI assistance: Lens = AI helping see/analyze each step clearly
- Methodology agnostic: Works for Scrum sprints OR Waterfall phases
- Clarity: AI brings focus and understanding to complex workflows

## Variations to Create (3-4)
1. **Variant A**: 5 dots horizontal path, center dot highlighted, lens subtle
2. **Variant B**: 6 dots curved path (organic flow), glasses reflection prominent
3. **Variant C**: 4 dots with connecting lines emphasized, minimal lens
4. **Variant D**: 3D depth effect - dots at different "distances" in lens

## Technical Specs
- 28×28 SVG (Activity Bar primary)
- 128×128 PNG (Marketplace version)
- Circle stroke: 2px, dots: 4-6px diameter
- Connecting lines: 1px stroke
- Simplest geometry (best for small size rendering)
- Pure monochrome (most theme-compatible)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Path clearly visible at 28px (readability test)
- ✅ Highlighted step obvious (current focus)
- ✅ Lens/AI reference recognizable
- ✅ Clean rendering without blur/artifacts
- ✅ Most minimal of 3 concepts (fastest recognition)

## Advantages
- Perfect circle containment (no extending elements = simpler)
- Lowest complexity (best performance at small sizes)
- DevSteps name most literally visualized
- Theme compatibility easiest (solid shapes only)

## Tools
Grid-based construction essential. SVG optimization critical for clean small rendering.
