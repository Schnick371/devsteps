Create Gantt-style horizontal timeline showing epics/stories with start/end dates. Visual elements: Horizontal bars colored by status, dependencies as arrows, today marker line, zoom controls (week/month/quarter). Data requirements: Add created/updated as date proxies, optional start_date/end_date fields. Implementation: SVG-based custom renderer OR Timeline.js library. Interactions: Click bar to open item, hover shows details tooltip, drag to adjust dates (future). Filters: Show/hide completed items, filter by epic, priority. Performance: Virtualize rows for 100+ items.
