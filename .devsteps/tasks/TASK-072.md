## Concept Overview
**Visual**: Scrum/Kanban board columns viewed THROUGH Copilot glasses lenses - AI's perspective on workflow.

## Design Elements
- **Circle base**: Round visible area (square canvas)
- **3 vertical lanes**: Simplified Todo/In-Progress/Done columns as minimal bars/lines
- **Copilot glasses overlay**: Glasses frame NOT covering, but framing the view (partnership metaphor)
- **Small cards/items**: Minimal dots/rectangles moving through lanes
- **Extending elements**: Glasses temples/arms extend beyond circle boundary

## Symbolism
- Human-AI partnership: AI viewing and understanding YOUR workflow
- Copilot perspective: Glasses = AI vision/analysis
- Unique positioning: Only DevSteps icon showing "workflow through AI lens"

## Variations to Create (3-4)
1. **Variant A**: Thick glasses frame, 3 bold lanes, high contrast
2. **Variant B**: Subtle glasses outline, 4 lanes with dots, minimalist
3. **Variant C**: Glasses at angle (dynamic), lanes with cards, modern
4. **Variant D**: Monochrome test - all currentColor compatible

## Technical Specs
- 28×28 SVG (Activity Bar primary)
- 128×128 PNG (Marketplace version)
- 2px stroke weight, round linecap/linejoin
- Monochrome-first (currentColor), optional blue accent for marketplace
- Test in light/dark VS Code themes

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Recognizable as "workflow board" at 28px
- ✅ Glasses clearly visible (Copilot reference)
- ✅ All elements within/extending circle correctly
- ✅ Works in both light and dark themes
- ✅ Unique compared to other VS Code extensions

## Tools
Figma, Inkscape, or Illustrator for vector work. Export SVG with clean paths.
