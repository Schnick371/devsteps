## Concept Overview
**Visual**: Dual footprints (human left, AI right) walking side-by-side - literal DevSteps name + partnership.

## Design Elements
- **Circle contains**: Two footprints positioned side-by-side
- **Left footprint**: Organic human shoe print (natural curves)
- **Right footprint**: Geometric/circuit-pattern AI footprint (tech aesthetic)
- **Copilot glasses**: Small icon in corner viewing/guiding (subtle reference)
- **Extending elements**: Path lines/arrow extend beyond circle showing forward motion

## Symbolism
- DevSteps name: Literal footsteps visualization
- Partnership: Walking together (not AI replacing human)
- Journey metaphor: Progress, incremental steps, guided path
- Dual nature: Organic + Digital working as one

## Variations to Create (3-4)
1. **Variant A**: Both footprints same size, path arrow extends, glasses in top-right
2. **Variant B**: AI footprint slightly ahead (leading), circuit pattern detailed
3. **Variant C**: Footprints overlapping (close collaboration), minimalist
4. **Variant D**: Side view (profile) of steps, glasses centered above

## Technical Specs
- 28×28 SVG (Activity Bar primary)
- 128×128 PNG (Marketplace version)
- 2px stroke weight for footprint outlines
- Circuit pattern: Simple lines (avoid complexity at small size)
- Monochrome + optional blue accent for AI footprint

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Both footprints clearly distinguishable at 28px
- ✅ Human vs AI footprint difference obvious
- ✅ DevSteps name connection clear (footsteps = steps)
- ✅ Glasses element visible but not dominant
- ✅ Forward motion/progress feeling conveyed

## Tools
Vector editor with pattern/texture tools for circuit effect. Grid-based construction for precision.
