## Implementation Summary

Created 4 SVG variations for Concept 2 "Footsteps + Glasses Hybrid" - visualizing human-AI partnership through literal footsteps metaphor.

### Deliverables Created

1. **Variant A: Side-by-Side Forward Path** (1.9KB)
   - Equal partnership visualization
   - Forward path arrow extending beyond circle
   - Glasses in top-right corner

2. **Variant B: AI Leading with Detailed Circuit** (2.2KB)
   - AI footprint positioned ahead (guiding role)
   - Detailed circuit pattern (5 traces, 4 nodes)
   - Path line showing walking direction

3. **Variant C: Overlapping Close Collaboration** (1.8KB)
   - Footprints overlapping (tight integration)
   - Minimalist circuit pattern
   - Glasses centered above (overseeing)
   - Progress dots extending downward

4. **Variant D: Side View Profile Steps** (2.1KB)
   - Profile perspective with ground line
   - Motion arrow showing forward direction
   - Step sequence dots (4 dots progression)
   - Larger glasses element centered

5. **README.md** (3.8KB)
   - Complete design rationale
   - Variant characteristics and symbolism
   - Technical specifications
   - Usage recommendations
   - Next steps for testing/selection

### Design Decisions

**Footsteps Metaphor:**
- Literal "DevSteps" name visualization
- Universal journey/progress symbol
- Human footprint: Organic curves (natural shoe shape)
- AI footprint: Geometric patterns (circuit-enhanced)

**Partnership Variations:**
- A: Equal (side-by-side)
- B: AI leads (guidance)
- C: Overlap (integration)
- D: Journey (side perspective)

**Copilot Glasses Integration:**
- Subtle reference, not dominant
- Positioned strategically per variant
- Maintains AI perspective theme
- Supports main footsteps concept

**Technical Specs Met:**
- ✅ 28×28 size with 24×24 viewBox
- ✅ Stroke widths: 2px circle, 1.5-1.8px footprints, 1-1.2px circuits
- ✅ currentColor throughout (theme compatible)
- ✅ Extending elements (arrows, dots, path lines)
- ✅ Clear human vs AI distinction at small size

### Recommendations

**Best for Activity Bar (28×28):**
- Variant A or C (clearest at small size)

**Best for Marketplace (128×128):**
- Variant B or D (detail scales well)
