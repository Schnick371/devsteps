# Update devsteps-plan-work.prompt.md

## Completed Implementation

Updated prompt with concise branch enforcement:

### Changes Made:
1. **Mission Section:** Added "Branch Strategy" note - work items in `main` ONLY
2. **Step 0: Branch Preparation:** Added verification step - check on `main` before planning
3. **Step 7: Commit to Main:** Added mandatory commit workflow with prohibitions
4. **Key Principle:** Work items = metadata → belong in `main`, feature branches come later

### Result:
- Clear, scannable format for Copilot
- Branch discipline enforced at key decision points
- No verbose instructions - just critical checks
- Production-ready implementation

## Success Criteria Met:
- ✅ Step 0 checks main branch (concise version)
- ✅ Step 7 commits items to main (with prohibitions)
- ✅ Mission statement clarifies branch strategy
- ✅ "When Complete" links to start-work prompt
- ✅ Kept concise for Copilot consumption

**Note:** Implementation is more concise than original task spec - this is intentional and better for usability.
