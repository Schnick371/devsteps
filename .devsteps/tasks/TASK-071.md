Scope: Status icons (draft, in-progress, review, done, blocked, cancelled), priority icons (critical, high, medium, low), type icons (epic, story, task, bug, spike, feature, requirement, test), action icons (add, edit, delete, refresh, filter, sort). Design principles: Match Activity Bar icon style, consistent stroke width and style, work in light/dark themes, 16x16 or 24x24 sizes for UI. Format: SVG with currentColor, organized in resources/icons/ subdirectories. Documentation: icon-library.md with usage guidelines and visual catalog. Acceptance criteria: Complete icon set for extension needs, consistent visual style, documented usage, integrated in TreeView and commands.
